The goal of OmopSketch is to characterise and visualise an Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) instance to asses if it meets the necessary criteria to answer a specific clinical question and conduct a certain study.

## Installation

**OmopSketch** is available from CRAN:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("OmopSketch")
```

Or you can install the development version of OmopSketch from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("OHDSI/OmopSketch")
```

## Working with OMOP


```{r, echo=FALSE}
visOmopResults::setGlobalPlotOptions(style = list.files(system.file("brand", package = "OmopSketch"), full.names = TRUE, pattern = "^readme\\.yml$"))
visOmopResults::setGlobalTableOptions(style = list.files(system.file("brand", package = "OmopSketch"), full.names = TRUE, pattern = "^readme\\.yml$"))
```


The first step to any analysis you will create what we call the `cdm_reference` object, which is a reference to the OMOP CDM tables. If you want to learn more about OMOP or the `cdm_reference` object you can take a look to:

- [Tidy R programming with the OMOP Common Data Model](https://ohdsi.github.io/Tidy-R-programming-with-OMOP/)
- [The book of OHDSI](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/)

In general, you will create a cdm_reference object using the [CDMConnector](https://darwin-eu.github.io/CDMConnector/) package, in our case we will use the Eunomia *GiBleed* mock dataset available through [omock](https://ohdsi.github.io/omock/):

```{r}
library(omock)

cdm <- mockCdmFromDataset(datasetName = "GiBleed", source = "duckdb")
cdm
```

## Sketching your cdm

```{r}
library(OmopSketch)
library(dplyr)
```

Once we have the `cdm_reference` object we can start characterising it, there are several functionalities available on *OmopSketch* the main ones:

### Snapshot

We first create a snapshot of our database. This will allow us to track when the analysis has been conducted and capture details about the CDM version or the data release.

```{r}
snapshot <- summariseOmopSnapshot(cdm = cdm)

tableOmopSnapshot(result = snapshot, type = "flextable")

```

### Characterise the person table

Once we have collected the snapshot information, we can characterise the person table with `summarisePersonTable()`:

```{r}
result <- summarisePerson(cdm = cdm)

tablePerson(result = result, type = "flextable")
```

### Characterise the observation period

We can then explore the observation period details. You can visualise and explore the characteristics of the observation period per each individual in the database using `summariseObservationPeriod()`.

```{r}
result <- summariseObservationPeriod(cdm = cdm)

tableObservationPeriod(result = result, type = "flextable")
```

Or if visualisation is preferred, you can easily build a histogram to explore how many participants have more than one observation period.

```{r}
plotObservationPeriod(result = result, colour = "observation_period_ordinal")
```

### Characterise the clinical tables

Now, we can start characterising the clinical tables of the CDM. By using `summariseClinicalRecords()` and `tableClinicalRecords()`, we can easily visualise the main characteristics of specific clinical tables.

```{r}
result <- summariseClinicalRecords(
  cdm = cdm, 
  omopTableName = c("condition_occurrence", "drug_exposure")
)

tableClinicalRecords(result = result, type = "flextable")
```

### Explore trends over time

After visualising the main characteristics of our clinical tables, we can also explore trends over time using `summariseTrend()`.

```{r}
result <- summariseTrend(
  cdm = cdm, 
  event = c("condition_occurrence", "drug_exposure"), 
  output = "record",  
  interval = "years"
)

plotTrend(result = result, facet = "omop_table", colour = "cdm_name")
```

### Characterise the concepts

OmopSketch also provides functions to explore the concepts in the dataset.

```{r}

result <- summariseConceptIdCounts(
  cdm = cdm, 
  omopTableName = "drug_exposure"
)

tableTopConceptCounts(result = result, type = "flextable")

```

### Characterise the cdm

To obtain and explore a complete characterisation of a cdm, you can use the OmopSketch functions `databaseCharacteristics()` and `shinyCharacteristics()`. These functions allow you to generate and interactively explore detailed summaries of your database. To see an example of the outputs produced, explore the characterisation of several synthetic datasets [here](https://dpa-pde-oxford.shinyapps.io/OmopSketchCharacterisation/).

As seen, OmopSketch offers multiple functionalities to provide a general overview of a database. Additionally, it includes more tools and arguments that allow for deeper exploration, helping to assess the database's suitability for specific research studies.
