header: OmopSketch Database Characterisation
---

### Shiny App Overview

This Shiny App presents the results of a database characterisation performed using the [**OmopSketch**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=OmopSketch) R package. It provides summaries and visualisations to support exploration of OMOP CDM-compliant datasets.

The app includes the following components:

- **Snapshot**: Metadata extracted from the `cdm_source` table, using the output of [`summariseOmopSnapshot()`](https://ohdsi.github.io/OmopSketch/reference/summariseOmopSnapshot.html).
- **Population Characteristics**: Summary of the demographics of the population in observation, generated using [**CohortConstructor**](https://ohdsi.github.io/CohortConstructor/) and [**CohortCharacteristics**](https://darwin-eu.github.io/CohortCharacteristics/).
- **Person**: Summary of person table, from [`summarisePerson()`]()
- **Observation Period**: Distribution and length of observation periods, based on [`summariseObservationPeriod()`](https://ohdsi.github.io/OmopSketch/reference/summariseObservationPeriod.html).
- **Trends**: Temporal trends of individuals and records in observation, including changes in median age, proportion of females, and number of person-days, generated from [`summariseTrend()`](https://ohdsi.github.io/OmopSketch/reference/summariseTrend.html).
- **Clinical Records**: Summary of clinical tables focused on vocabulary usage and quality checks, from [`summariseClinicalRecords()`](https://ohdsi.github.io/OmopSketch/reference/summariseClinicalRecords.html).
- **Concept Counts** *(optional)*: Counts of `concept_id`s across tables, generated by [`summariseConceptIdCounts()`](https://ohdsi.github.io/OmopSketch/reference/summariseConceptIdCounts.html).

#### Shiny generation

The Shiny application is created using the following code:

```
library(OmopSketch)

shinyCharacteristics(
  result = results,
  directory = getwd(), 
  background = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHDSI/OmopSketch/refs/heads/main/extras/background-synthetic-data.md",
  logo = "https://github.com/OHDSI/OmopSketch/blob/main/man/figures/logo.png?raw=true"
)
```

You can view the complete script used to generate the results and create the app [here](https://github.com/OHDSI/OmopSketch/blob/main/extras/createShiny.R)
