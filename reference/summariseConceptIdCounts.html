<dd><p>A <code>cdm_reference</code> object. Use <em>CDMConnector</em> to create a reference
to a database or <em>omock</em> to create a reference to synthetic data.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-omoptablename">omopTableName<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-omoptablename"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A character vector of the names of the tables to
summarise in the cdm object. Run <code><a href="clinicalTables.html">clinicalTables()</a></code> to check the
available options.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-countby">countBy<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-countby"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Either "record" for record-level counts or "person" for
person-level counts.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-interval">interval<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-interval"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Time interval to stratify by. It can either be "years",
"quarters", "months" or "overall".</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-sex">sex<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-sex"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Logical; whether to stratify results by sex (<code>TRUE</code>) or not
(<code>FALSE</code>).</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-agegroup">ageGroup<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-agegroup"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A list of age groups to stratify the results by. Each element
represents a specific age range. You can give them specific names, e.g.
<code>ageGroup = list(children = c(0, 17), adult = c(18, Inf))</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-inobservation">inObservation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-inobservation"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Logical. If <code>TRUE</code>, the results are stratified to
indicate whether each record occurs within an observation period.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-sample">sample<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-sample"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Either an integer or a character string.</p><ul><li><p>If an integer (n &gt; 0), the function will first sample <code>n</code> distinct
<code>person_id</code>s from the <code>person</code> table and then subset the input tables to
those subjects.</p></li>
<li><p>If a character string, it must be the name of a cohort in the <code>cdm</code>; in
this case, the input tables are subset to subjects (<code>subject_id</code>) belonging
to that cohort.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <code>NULL</code> to disable subsetting (default value).</p></li>
</ul></dd>


<dt id="arg-daterange">dateRange<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-daterange"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A vector of two dates defining the desired study period.
Only the <code>start_date</code> column of the OMOP table is checked to ensure it falls within this range.
If <code>dateRange</code> is <code>NULL</code>, no restriction is applied.</p></dd>
